title: What do we have here...

It's been a long time coming! After spending the past few college basketball seasons scraping box scores, dumping the results into a massive Google Sheets page, formatting a bracket to look pretty with team logos and colors, and taking screenshots to share to [Twitter](https://x.com/AI_Bracketology) (I'm not calling it X), I have finally set up a [website](https://ai-bracketology.github.io/cbb-rankings/) that auto-updates my bracketology daily!

Well, I should clarify something... I'm not sure that I can call this 'bracketology'. My definition of bracketology is predicting what the NCAA Tournament field will look like. This site is more 'this is what the field should be' and less 'this is what I think the field will be'. I think that's an important distinction, and as a result, you might see projections here that are different from traditional bracketologists. 


Before I jump into some of the cooler features of this site, a couple more notes on my method:
- First of all, despite my name, there is no AI involved with any of the bracketing decisions. When I first started my Twitter, I trained an AI model on past selection committee decisions to predict future ones. This got annoying with 1) The changing of teamsheet metrics every year, and 2) The committee seemingly changing what is important every year. Maybe I'll change my name next season, especially since 'AI' gets such a negative visceral reaction from people with all the slop you see on social media these days (that being said, as someone who works in the CompSci/Robotics industry, there are a lot of AI applications that I truly think make the world a better, healthier place!)

- Now to the bracket. I think it's pretty simple who deserves to be in the NCAA Tournament: 1) There are 31 automatic qualifiers that have won their conference tournament, and 2) Of the remaining teams, there are 37 at-large teams that have the best resumes. I don't care how ugly the basketball might be (shoutout [Virginia 2023-24](https://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/game/_/gameId/401638580/colorado-st-virginia)), if you are one of the best 37 teams at finding ways to win games, you should be in the field.
- What does this mean? I am heavy on WAB (the committee has [emphasized its important](https://x.com/jeffborzello/status/2024575181897818461)). I calculate my own version of WAB (slightly different from the [NCAA](https://stats.ncaa.org/selection_rankings/nitty_gritties/48872) and [Torvik](https://barttorvik.com/trank.php#) versions), and then use this WAB to calculate a SLCT score. There is some efficiency baked in, but it's mostly WAB. After removing the 31 AQs, my at-large teams are the teams with the next 37 highest SLCT scores.
- Next, those 68 teams in my field are seeded using a SEED score. This is very similar to SLCT, but with the thumb a bit harder on the scale for efficiency (this is what pulls down teams like UConn and Miami OH, and pulls up teams like Florida and Louisville).
- Ta-da. Head over to the **Bracketology** tab on the main page to see what my field looks like today. I should note that it's different than the field I [tweeted out yesterday](https://x.com/AI_Bracketology/status/2024490764013584386), and that's because of some new changes I've made with calculating my WAB, SLCT, and SEED scores. I'll keep my twitter bracket going for the rest of this season, while having this running as another projection of the field (the more the merrier, right?) 
- I've done some cool projections on my Twitter, such as posting [expected seed odds](https://x.com/AI_Bracketology/status/2024496973496098918) for all teams and giving [seed probabilities for each team based on how they finish the season](https://x.com/AI_Bracketology/status/2024522575699706283). Eventually, I'll get those working on this website to update daily with everything else. For now, you're stuck with me and my Google Sheets screenshots.
- I also show SOS, NC SOS, and Quadrant records. Important note: these are my own quadrants, not the official NCAA NET ones. Again, it's similar to the NET breakdown, but I wanted to create my own thing.
- The **Bubble Watch** tabs shows the 20 or so teams fighting for their tournament lives, from the current 10 seeds to the Next 4 Out.


And now, some notes on what you can find here, non-bracketology related:
- The main page of this site has custom efficiency rankings for each team. I've spent a bit of time researching how all the big boys do this (KenPom, Torvik) and added my own twists. The efficiencies are adjusted for opponent, margin-capped, and use Bayesian priors for early-season stability. It's close to those traditional sites, although there are some teams that are 15+ spots different. But I think this is OK; I'm not trying to conform but rather introduce another metric for rating team performance!
- The fire and ice emojis show teams that have been performing better or worse over the past 5 games. When implementing this, I found that most of the fire emojis were given to teams at the bottom of the rankings, and most of the ice emojis were given to teams at the top. This made sense, as teams that have been awesome are more likely to play 'below' their standards. I've since changed this to show hot/cold in each 'tier' of teams... i.e. Michigan is hot now relative to their own performance AND the teams around them in effiency ranking. 
- Hop on over to the **Advanced Stats** tab now. There's three sections of stats here: Shooting, Ball Control, and Point Breakdown (points off turnover, on fastbreak, and in the paint). You can sort by any of these categories to see what teams in D1 are the best at each!
- Try clicking on a [conference](https://ai-bracketology.github.io/cbb-rankings/conference.html?conf=Big%20Ten) next to one of the teams: this let's you view the same efficiency and advanced stats for teams in a single conference.


And now for the team pages:
- Click any [team](https://ai-bracketology.github.io/cbb-rankings/team.html?team=MICH) on that main page to see game results, with a full stats breakdown. The **Show Advanced Stats** toggle gives you a look at those same advanced stats from above on a per game basis.
- WAB gained or lost from each game.
- Two tabs for 'WAB Trend' and 'AdjE vs Expected'. 'WAB Trend' shows how a teams WAB has changed over the course of the season, 'AdjE vs Expected' shows how much each team has outperformed/underperformed their expectation for each game, with a trendline to show rolling 5-game average.

- Splits table at the top gives a breakdown for Home/Away/Neutral.


And finally, game results:
- On the main page, give [Latest Game Results](https://ai-bracketology.github.io/cbb-rankings/game_date.html) a click. Here, you can see games from the previous day, with actual vs expected outcome and a 'Ball Score' (this is jsimply the two teams total AdjE, used to sort games between higher ranked teams).
- You can also hop over to the **Biggest Upsets** tab to view the most shocking results from the season!

That's all! I'll be adding more and more to this over the couple weeks, but if anyone has any feature requests please give me a shout! I've started toying around with play-by-plays to calculate individual player Offensive and Defensive Ratings, but this is quite the project and likely won't be ready until next season. I'll occasionally make new blog posts here when I feel inclined, and will update when I do on my Twitter, so give it a follow.
