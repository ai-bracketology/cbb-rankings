title: It's blind resume season!

The snow is finally melting on the east coast, mid-major conference tournaments are [right around the corner](https://x.com/bracketproject/status/2026115079952081128), and everyone is in agreement that we definitely DO NOT need to expand to more than 68 tournament teams. Well, almost [everyone](https://x.com/SethDavisHoops/status/2025681839755845745). 

What does this all mean? It's the season for blind resumes!

A tradition as old as Joe Lunardi, there is nothing quite like cherry-picking statistics that show why your team should be playing in the NCAA Tournament.

Exhibit A:

Clearly, team A has a better resume and should be in the tournament. Q4 losses are the plague, and BPI is the most important predictive metric (just kidding, [I hate BPI](https://x.com/AI_Bracketology/status/1892595873177112593?s=20)). 

The team reveal:

    Revenge for the Mountaineers

Obviously, there are many other reasons why TCU is a bubble team right now (in for [some](https://x.com/AI_Bracketology/status/2027031570553373166), out for [others](https://x.com/AI_Bracketology/status/2027031563146322008?s=20)) and West Virginia is [not close to the field](https://ai-bracketology.github.io/cbb-rankings/team.html?team=WVU). Although, I wouldn't hate letting the Mountaineers in after the atrocity of leaving them out last season.

All this being said, I've added a **Comparison Tool** tab to my website. This shows all the important teamsheet metrics in one clean table, and even let's you breakdown quadrant records by Home/Away/Neutral splits. You can enter which teams you want to compare, whether it be which of the best teams deserve that last 1 seed or what bubble teams deserve to be playing in Dayton. Give it a try, and let me know what you think. I'm always open to feedback and adding additional features!
